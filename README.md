## About

A social media application to share songs that you've had looping in the background! This application is in its very early stages. Currently, I have completed the design and the authentication process. Now, I'm working on implementing the features that utilize the Spotify API. <br/>

**Planned features:** <br/>

- ~~Home page will display your top five tracks based on plays, using the Spotify API~~
- Stats of how many songs, artists, and albums you've listened to
- Ability to like and comment on posts, and add songs to your Spotify playlists
- Follow and be followed by other users
- Search for posts and users
- A profile page that has all of the user's posts

## Tools

- React (with Typescript)
- React Router
- Vite
- Firebase
- NodeJS (for Firebase cloud functions)
- Spotify API
- SASS
